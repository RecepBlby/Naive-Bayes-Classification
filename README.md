# Naive-Bayes-Classification
 is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task.Naïve Bayes algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm, which is based on Bayes theorem and used for solving classification problems.It is mainly used in text classification that includes a high-dimensional training dataset. It is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on the basis of the probability of an object.
